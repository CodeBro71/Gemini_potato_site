                <p>The Great Irish Potato Famine, also known as the Great Hunger (An Gorta MÃ³r in Irish), was a period of mass starvation, disease, and emigration that occurred in Ireland from 1845 to 1852.  This historical event remains a defining moment in Irish history and its diaspora.</p>
                <p>Let's explore the causes, impact, and lasting legacy of this tragedy.</p>

            <div class="tab-pane" id="causes">
                <h2>Causes of the Famine</h2>
                <p>The immediate cause of the famine was the infestation of potato crops by a water mold called Phytophthora infestans, which caused late blight. This disease destroyed the potato plants, leaving the population with little to no food source.</p>
                <p>However, several underlying factors contributed to the severity of the famine:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Dependence on the Potato:**  Irish people heavily relied on potatoes for most of their diet, making them extremely vulnerable to a potato crop failure.</li>
                    <li>**Landlord System:** Ireland was under British rule, and a harsh landownership system forced tenant farmers to cultivate cash crops like grain for export, even though they couldn't eat them.</li>
                    <li>**Government Relief Efforts:** The British government's relief efforts were widely criticized as inadequate and insensitive to the dire situation.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Impact of the Famine</h2>
                <p>The impact of the Famine was devastating. Estimates suggest over one million people died from starvation or famine-related diseases like typhus.</p>
                <p>Millions more were forced to emigrate, particularly to North America, forever altering the demographics of Ireland and the receiving countries.</p>
                <p>The Famine also had lasting social, political, and economic consequences that continue to shape Irish identity today.</p>
